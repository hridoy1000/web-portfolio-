        <h3>Become's world No.1 Web Devoloper</h3>
        <p>The word dream is a combination of images, thoughts and emotions that human beings see and hear in their mind when they are sleeping. Dreams can be extraordinarily vivid, splendid or vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images; focused and understandable or unclear and confusing. They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange.</p>
